Contributing
============

Typically development is done on the master branch:

1. Fork the repository
2. Install prerequisites (python3-dev, uuid-runtime)
3. Implement the new feature or bug fix
4. Implement test case(s) to ensure that future changes do not break legacy
5. Run the tests
6. Create a pull request
