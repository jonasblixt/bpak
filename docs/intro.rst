BPAK Introduction
-----------------

Bitpacker or bpak for short is a tool and library for creating firmware archives
that can be cryptographically signed, support custom metadata and enable
advanced update schemes. Bitpacker is primarily designed for embedded systems.

Embedded systems are often composed of several software components, for example:
bootloader, kernel, file systems, device configuration, third party applications,
etc. It is common to have many different formats and tools for the various
components.

One of the main goals with bitpacker is to reduce the number of tools and
formats required to manage these components.

Core concepts
-------------

A bpak archive is composed of a 4kByte header and parts. A part is any kind
of data. The header contains a list of parts, a list of meta data and details
about how the package should be hashed and signed. 2kBytes are reserved for 
actual metadata within the header.

The metadata header encodes and id, size and offset within the metadata block
of the header. An optional part-reference can be populated if the metadata
belongs to a specific part.

Bitpacker id's are generated by computing a crc32 checksum of a character string.
For example the package identifier type 'bpak-package', when translated using
the bpak_id-function results in bpak_id('bpak-package') = 0xfb2f1f3f.

To facilitate efficient over-the-air updates a bpak file can be encoded for
transport. In transport some or all parts are encoded, typically using the
bsdiff algorithm.

Bitpacker supports two different signing schemes, one where the private key is
available on disk which is appropriate for un-controlled development keys but
makes life easier for day-to-day development. The second way is to export a
binary hash that can be signed in a controlled environment. Bitpacker supports
retrofitting DER formatted signatures, which, for example, is what openssl can
produce. This way an approved release candidate can be re-signed with
production keys without rebuilding all the artefacts that make up a bpak archive.

Limitations
-----------

Bitpacker is not a complete package management system, it provides some
necessary low level primitives that can enable such a system. If you choose
to use it there is likely a lot of integration work that needs to be done
before it is useful in any sense of the word.

The library and format does not specify how to install a package and therefore left as an implementation detail.

Bitpacker is new and not really supported by any other projects except the
punchboot bootloader (https://github.com/jonasblixt/punchboot)

The library does not include any cryptographic API or functionality, it only
comes with a structure for storing signatures and some concepts to enable
signature verification and key management.
